### My Role in This Team
First 2 weeks I was responsible for DATABASE, finding the relevancy, quality and productivity of data. I worked on initial ERD and SQL frame. The work wasn’t easy, but the support of my group members made, and our continuous discussions made it look pretty simple. Later I moved on to improvise and update README and GitHub part of the project. I assisted the main lead for GitHub portion.

### Personal Challenge
I found Machine learning portion to be a bit daunting but thanks to Suyin, one of our very supportive and intelligent members, that part was left for us for discussing ideas and probable ways of execution. In general, I found my self enjoying Python, Tableau and SQL. I thought initially that I am forgetting things while we were cruising along the course but at the time of this final project I realised we were taught pretty well and everything made a lot of sense. 

### Team Challenge
Usually, teams encounter issues like lake of participation or putting the ideas on the table but thankfully in our team no question was a bad question, no idea was a vague idea and communication was pretty smooth. I was introduced to most of the team members for the first time and I ended up hating them all (the fact that I can say I hate you shows level of friendship we developed in such a small span of time) 

### Team Strength
To me the team strength was everyone took charge and everyone listened. Everyone tried their best to keep the morale high and at no point in time we felt that we were lagging. The confidence each member showed on each other and the genuine intent of reaching out to help the other team member made us a unit. 

### Summary of project
•	Topic: How do Disney movie clusters in order to help us make informed decisions for other Disney business verticals.
•	ML Model: K-Means Clustering & K-Nearest Neighbor
•	Results: We are able to find the nearest neighbors of each movie titles. With this information, we are then able to use in the other business verticals for toys creation, merchandise product placements, location to build park rides within Disneyland, potential franchise partnership and collaborations.

### Acknowledgment

I want to extent my gratitude towards the whole Boot Camp team who made such a fast paced course a park ride for us. Specially our intsructor Nick and other assitant instructors who guided us all along. I feel a huge difference in my skillset with in a span of 6 months. Thank you !!
